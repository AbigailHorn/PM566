<h2>Overview</h2>

<h2>Course objectives</h2>
</div>
<div id="core-texts" class="section level2">
<h2>Core Texts</h2>
<p>We will be using the book <a href="https://leanpub.com/rprogramming">R Programming for Data Science</a> by <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/">Roger D. Peng</a> as our main text. The book is freely avaliable <a href="https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/">online</a> but <a href="https://leanpub.com/rprogramming">pdf</a> versions and <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/http://www.lulu.com/shop/roger-peng/r-programming-for-data-science/paperback/product-22655166.html">printed</a> versions are avaliable too. Other texts will be used from class to class and will be detailed in <a href="/reading">Readings</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-material" class="section level2">
<h2>Other Material</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a> by Garrett Grolemund &amp; Hadley Wickham. Is another highly rated book which covers many of the same topics as R Programming for Data Science.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="software" class="section level2">
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>We will do all of our visualization work in this class using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>. We will use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> to manage our code and projects.</p>
<p>You will need to install some software first. Here is what to do:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Get the most recent version of R. R is free and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. <a href="http://cloud.r-project.org">Download</a> the version of R compatible with your operating system. If you are running Windows or MacOS, you should choose one of the <em>precompiled binary</em> distributions (i.e., ready-to-run applications) linked at the top of the R Project’s webpage.</li>
<li>Once R is installed, <a href="http://rstudio.com">download and install R Studio</a>. R Studio is an “Integrated Development Environment”, or IDE. This means it is a front-end for R that makes it much easier to work with. R Studio is also free, and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.</li>
<li><a href="http://tidyverse.org">Install the tidyverse library</a> and several other add-on packages for R. These libraries provide useful functionality that we will take advantage of throughout the book. You can learn more about the tidyverse’s family of packages at its website.</li>
</ol>
<p>To install the tidyverse, make sure you have an Internet connection and then launch R Studio. Type the following lines of code at R’s command prompt, located in the window named “Console”, and hit return. In the code below, the <code>&lt;-</code> arrow is made up of two keystrokes, first <code>&lt;</code> and then the short dash or minus symbol, <code>-</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_packages &lt;- c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)

install.packages(my_packages, repos = &quot;http://cran.rstudio.com&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>R Studio should then download and install these packages for you. It may take a little while to download everything.</p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>
{{% topiclist %}}
<p>As the weeks go by, consult the <a href="/schedule/">Schedule Page</a> for more information on weekly topics, problem sets, readings, and other materials. The schedule is likely to change as we go. Links to readings, assignments, and other materials from class will be posted on that page.</p>
</div>
<div id="statement-for-students-with-disabilities" class="section level2">
<h2>Statement for students with disabilities</h2>
<p>Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability is required to register with Disability Services and Programs (DSP) each semester. A letter of verification for approved accommodations can be obtained from DSP. Please be sure the letter is delivered to me (or to TA) as early in the semester as possible. DSP is located in STU 301 and is open 8:30 a.m.–5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. The phone number for DSP is (213) 740-0776.</p>

<h2>Statement on academic conduct and support systems</h2>
<div id="academic-conduct" class="section level3">
<h3>Academic Conduct:</h3>
<p>Plagiarism – presenting someone else’s ideas as your own, either verbatim or recast in
your own words – is a serious academic offense with serious consequences. Please
familiarize yourself with the discussion of plagiarism in SCampus in Part B, Section 11,
“Behavior Violating University Standards” policy.usc.edu/scampus-part-b. Other forms
of academic dishonesty are equally unacceptable. See additional information in SCampus
and university policies on scientific misconduct, policy.usc.edu/scientific-misconduct.</p>
