# Course Material for PM566

The course website is based off the [course template](https://github.com/kjhealy/course_template) by [Kieran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org/).

This skeleton uses the [Academic Hugo theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/), with some slight template modifications found in `/assets/` 
and `layouts/`. The theme is included as a submodule, so when when cloning for the first time, use this command to get the theme too:

    git submodule update --init --recursive
